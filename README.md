Given that the task is to create a web application, we'll use JavaScript and HTML5's canvas for rendering, and CSS for styling. We'll also use a simple Node.js server to serve the static files. 

The main files we'll need are:

- `server.js`: This is the entry point to our application. It will start a simple HTTP server that serves our static files.
- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that users will see when they visit our application. It will contain a canvas element for rendering the laser light display.
- `styles.css`: This file will contain the CSS styles for our application.
- `laserLight.js`: This file will contain the JavaScript code that creates the dynamic lattice pattern of laser light on the canvas.

Let's start with `server.js`:
