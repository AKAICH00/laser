Specification for Dynamic Laser Light Display Web Application

1. Overview
The application is a web-based program that generates a dynamic lattice pattern of laser light. It employs the full color spectrum to enhance the visual appeal of the display. The application is designed to be high performance and responsive on various devices and screen sizes.

2. Core Features
   - Dynamic Laser Light Display: The application will generate a lattice pattern of laser light that dynamically changes over time.
   - Full Color Spectrum: The application will utilize the full color spectrum to enhance the visual appeal of the laser light display.
   - Device Responsiveness: The application will be responsive and performant on various devices and screen sizes.

3. Core Classes and Functions
   - LaserLight: This class represents a single laser light. It has properties for color, position, and direction.
   - LatticePattern: This class generates and manages the lattice pattern of laser lights. It uses multiple instances of the LaserLight class.
   - ColorGenerator: This class generates colors from the full color spectrum. It is used to set the color of each LaserLight instance.
   - DisplayManager: This class manages the display of the lattice pattern. It ensures that the pattern is displayed correctly on various devices and screen sizes.
   - AnimationManager: This class manages the animation of the lattice pattern. It updates the position and direction of each LaserLight instance over time.

4. Non-Standard Dependencies
   - Three.js: This is a JavaScript library used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.
   - GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): This is a JavaScript library used for creating high-performance animations.
   - dat.GUI: This is a lightweight controller library for JavaScript that allows users to manipulate variables and call functions on the fly.
   - WebGL (Web Graphics Library): This is a JavaScript API for rendering high-performance interactive 3D and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins.

5. Detailed Specification
   - The application starts by initializing the DisplayManager, which sets up the display to be responsive to various devices and screen sizes.
   - The LatticePattern class is then initialized. It creates multiple instances of the LaserLight class, arranging them in a lattice pattern.
   - Each LaserLight instance is assigned a color from the ColorGenerator class.
   - The AnimationManager is then started. It updates the position and direction of each LaserLight instance at regular intervals, creating a dynamic display.
   - The DisplayManager updates the display at regular intervals to reflect the changes in the lattice pattern.
   - The application continues to run, creating a visually engaging lattice pattern of laser light that dynamically changes over time.
